## Why This Matters

### What Happened Today:
- Figma Make crashed
- Homepage files lost (S-51-6025, M-51-6021, L-51-5445, Xl-51-5437, Hd-51-5441)
- Hours of work gone
- No way to recover
- Stressful situation

### What Will Happen With GitHub:
- Figma Make crashes (if it happens again)
- Open GitHub Desktop
- Click "Restore to yesterday"
- 30 seconds later: Everything back
- Continue working
- No stress

### The Difference:
| Without GitHub | With GitHub |
|----------------|-------------|
| Lost work | Never lose work |
| Manual backups | Automatic version history |
| Hard to share | One link to share |
| No collaboration | Team can comment |
| Figma Make dependent | Independent backup |

## Your Current Backups

### In Figma Make:

1. **November 13 Backup** (Yesterday)
   - Location: `/backups/2024-11-13-responsive-fixed/`
   - Status: Missing the /imports files
   - Can't fully restore homepage

2. **November 14 Backup** (Today - Just Created)
   - Location: `/backups/2024-11-14-checkout-complete/`
   - Status: Complete checkout page preserved
   - Limitation: Still vulnerable if Figma Make crashes again

### Problem with Current Backups:
- ❌ Only exist inside Figma Make
- ❌ Lost if Figma Make crashes
- ❌ No version history between backups
- ❌ Manual process (easy to forget)

### Solution: GitHub
- ✅ Exists outside Figma Make
- ✅ Safe from crashes
- ✅ Every commit is a version
- ✅ Automatic tracking

All three guides have troubleshooting sections and FAQs. Your backend developers also use GitHub daily and can help.

**Remember:** The first time is the hardest. After a few commits, it becomes second nature.
