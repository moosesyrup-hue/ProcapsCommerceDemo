### **Search: "sleep"**

**Andrew's Intro:**
> "I hear from customers every day about sleep struggles. Here's what I've learned actually works:"

**Andrew's Message:**
> "Quality sleep isn't just about being tired—it's a complex dance between minerals (especially Magnesium, which most of us don't get enough of), brain chemicals like GABA and Serotonin that help you feel calm, and your body's natural sleep-wake rhythm.
>
> I've formulated products that address these different pieces of the sleep puzzle. Some help you fall asleep faster, others help you stay asleep through the night, and some improve how deeply you sleep so you wake up actually feeling rested. The best part? These work with your body's natural processes—no grogginess the next day."

>
