## 🐛 What to Check If Something Looks Wrong

### **If a search shows no content:**
- Check if the search term exists in your data files
- Verify spelling matches exactly
- Try a partial match (e.g., "joint" instead of "joints")

### **If content looks generic/basic:**
- It might be a long-tail search using the fallback template
- Consider adding hand-written content if it's high-traffic
- Or add more data to make templates richer

### **If tone feels off:**
- Compare to hand-written examples
- Adjust templates in `/utils/contentTemplates.ts`
- Ensure data files have rich `commonCauses` and `supportiveApproaches`

## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: How do I know if it's using a template or hand-written content?**

A: Hand-written content is much more detailed and specific. Templates are good but more formulaic. Look at the quickFilters—hand-written ones are very specific (e.g., "😴 Falling Asleep" vs "All Products").

**Q: Can I see which template was used?**

A: Check `/utils/searchIntent.ts` - the code clearly shows which searches use hand-written content (with if-statements) vs templates (with function calls).

**Q: What if I want to improve a template-generated response?**

A: Two options:
1. Add hand-written content in `searchIntent.ts` for that specific search
2. Improve the template in `contentTemplates.ts` (affects ALL searches using that template)

**Q: How do I add a new search term?**

A: Just add the data to the appropriate file in `/data/`. The templates will automatically use it!
