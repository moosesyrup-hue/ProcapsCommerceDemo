# 📝 How to Edit Content Templates - For Andrew

## Quick Start

We've created **starter content** using AI, but it needs **your authentic voice**. Here are 3 easy ways to provide your content:

---

## ✍️ OPTION 1: Fill Out the CSV (Easiest)

**File:** `/templates/andrew-content-template.csv`

1. **Open in Excel or Google Sheets**
2. **Fill in each column with your words**
3. **Save and send back to dev team**

### What Each Column Means:

| Column | What to Write | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Search Term** | Already filled in | "Sleep" |
| **Title** | The headline customers see | "Let's talk about better sleep" |
| **Intro** | 1-2 sentences acknowledging their concern | "I hear from customers every day about sleep struggles..." |
| **Body Paragraph 1** | Explain the issue (2-4 sentences) | "Quality sleep depends on minerals, brain chemicals..." |
| **Body Paragraph 2** | Your solution/products (2-4 sentences) | "I've formulated products that address these pieces..." |
| **Quick Filters** | Already filled in | "😴 Falling Asleep" |
| **Notes** | Any special instructions | "Emphasize the no-grogginess aspect" |

## ✍️ OPTION 2: Write in Word Doc (Most Flexible)

**For each topic, write:**

```
=================================
TOPIC: SLEEP
=================================

TITLE:
Let's talk about better sleep

INTRO (1-2 sentences):
[Write your opening here - in your own words]

BODY (2-3 paragraphs):
[Paragraph 1: What causes the issue]

[Paragraph 2: Your approach and what to expect]

NOTES:
[Anything special you want to emphasize]

=================================
```

**Then save and send to dev team** - they'll format it for the website.

## ✍️ OPTION 3: Record Voice Notes (Fastest)

If you'd rather **talk than type**:

1. **Record yourself** on your phone
2. **Talk through each topic** like you're advising a customer
3. **Send audio files** to dev team
4. **They'll transcribe and format**

**What to say:**
- "For sleep, here's what I'd tell a customer..."
- "The way I think about joint health is..."
- "When someone asks me about fatigue, I say..."

---

## 💡 Writing Tips

### ✅ DO:

- **Use "I"** - "I've formulated...", "In my experience..."
- **Tell stories** - "One customer told me...", "When I developed this..."
- **Be honest** - "This takes 6-8 weeks to really work, but..."
- **Explain simply** - "Your brain is 60% fat—here's why that matters..."
- **Show empathy** - "I understand how frustrating this is..."
- **Share your philosophy** - "I've always believed..."

### ❌ DON'T:

- Use "we" (sounds corporate)
- Make unrealistic promises
- Use technical jargon without explaining it
- Be vague or generic
- Sound like marketing copy

---

## 📋 Template Structure

For each topic, include:

### 1. **ACKNOWLEDGMENT** (First sentence)
Recognize their struggle with empathy.

**Example:** "I hear from customers every day about sleep struggles."

### 2. **EDUCATION** (Middle section)
Explain what's happening in simple terms.

**Example:** "Quality sleep isn't just about being tired—it's about minerals, brain chemistry, and your body's natural rhythm."

### 3. **YOUR SOLUTION** (Next section)  
What you've created and why.

**Example:** "I've formulated products that address these different pieces. Some help you fall asleep faster, others help you stay asleep."

### 4. **EXPECTATIONS** (Last section)
What they can realistically expect.

**Example:** "Most people notice improvement within 1-2 weeks. The best part? These work with your body's natural processes."

## 🎨 Voice Examples

### ✅ GOOD (Sounds like Andrew):

> "In my 40+ years formulating supplements, I've learned that joint health requires two things: building blocks to repair cartilage, and support to calm inflammation. I like to explain it like maintaining a house—you need both materials to fix what's worn AND ways to prevent further damage."

**Why it works:**
- Personal experience ("40+ years")
- First person ("I've learned")
- Simple analogy (house maintenance)
- Educational but accessible

### ❌ NEEDS WORK (Too generic):

> "Joint health is important. Our products contain ingredients that support joints. Try our joint formula today."

**Why it doesn't work:**
- Impersonal ("our products")
- Vague ("ingredients that support")
- Sales-y ("try today")
- No education or context

## 📊 Time Estimate

- **Top 10 topics:** ~2-3 hours (these are most important)
- **Top 20 ingredients:** ~1-2 hours (if you want to personalize these)
- **Everything else:** Use AI templates (they're good enough for long-tail searches)

**Recommendation:** Start with just the Top 10 health topics. That covers 60-70% of searches and makes the biggest impact.

## 💬 Need Help?

**Questions while writing:**

- **"Does this sound too technical?"** → Read it out loud. Would your neighbor understand?
- **"Is this too long?"** → 2-3 paragraphs is perfect. More is OK if it's engaging.
- **"Should I mention specific products?"** → Yes! Explain why you formulated them.
- **"What if I'm not sure about the science?"** → Write it in your words. Dev team can fact-check.

**Contact your dev team if:**
- You want to see examples
- You prefer a different format
- You want to do a quick call to talk through a few topics
- You have questions about any topic
